but from looking at the actual repository, what should the homepage be and what links should it have on it?

To determine what the homepage of your healthcare staffing website should be and what links it should have, I’ve analyzed the GitHub repository (https://github.com/clairuth/healthcareStaffing) for your Laravel 10.x project. Currently, the repository reflects a fresh Laravel installation with minimal customization, and the default homepage is served by welcome.blade.php (explaining why you see the Laravel homepage when running php artisan serve). There are no explicit custom views, controllers, or routes defining a healthcare staffing-specific homepage, so we’ll infer the intended homepage based on the project’s purpose (a healthcare staffing platform) and standard Laravel practices. I’ll also propose links based on typical functionality for such a platform and align with your goal of deploying to HostGator.
