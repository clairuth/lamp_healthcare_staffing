# LAMP Stack Healthcare Staffing Platform - Todo List

## Phase 1: Planning & Design

### Step 002: Define LAMP stack project requirements and features
- [x] Create `lamp_stack_requirements.md` document.
- [x] Document core user roles (Healthcare Professional, Facility Admin, Platform Admin).
- [x] Detail functional requirements for worker profiles (ID, license, shot uploads).
- [x] Detail functional requirements for company portal (shift posting, information upload).
- [x] Specify payment system requirements (PayPal, CashApp, Coinbase, Zelle, escrow).
- [x] Outline secure database storage requirements for sensitive information.
- [x] Define skills assessment feature with ranking system.
- [x] Document Texas state board license verification integration requirements.
- [x] Emphasize mobile-responsive design requirements for the frontend (HTML, CSS, plain JS).
- [x] Detail non-functional requirements (security, performance, usability for LAMP).
- [x] Review and finalize requirements document.

### Step 003: Design MySQL database schema for LAMP stack
- [x] Design `users` table.
- [x] Design `healthcare_professionals` table (linking to users, storing license info, bio, etc.).
- [x] Design `credentials` table (for licenses, certifications, shots, with file paths for uploads).
- [x] Design `facilities` table (linking to users, storing facility info).
- [x] Design `shifts` table (posted by facilities, including details, required skills).
- [x] Design `shift_applications` table (professionals applying for shifts).
- [x] Design `skills` table (list of skills).
- [x] Design `professional_skills` table (linking professionals to skills, proficiency).
- [x] Design `skill_assessments` table (assessment questions, answers, scores, ranking).
- [x] Design `payments` table (transaction details, status, escrow info).
- [x] Design `payment_methods` table (user payment preferences).
- [x] Design tables for messaging/notifications if required.
- [x] Define relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types for all tables.
- [x] Create an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) or schema description document.
- [x] Review and finalize database schema.

## Phase 2: Backend Development

### Step 004: Set up PHP project structure and environment
- [x] Define a clear PHP project folder structure (e.g., includes, public, classes, templates).
- [x] Create basic configuration files (db_config.php, constants.php).
- [x] Set up a local Apache/PHP/MySQL development environment (if not already done by user).

### Step 005: Implement core backend functionality in PHP
- [x] Implement user registration (professional, facility, admin).
- [x] Implement user login and session management.
- [x] Implement user profile management (CRUD operations).
- [x] Implement credential upload and storage logic (file handling, database entries).
- [x] Implement shift creation and management by facilities.
- [x] Implement shift browsing and application by professionals.
- [x] Implement backend logic for skills assessment (storing questions, answers, calculating scores).
- [x] Implement basic API endpoints or request handlers for frontend interaction.
- [x] Implement security measures (input validation, XSS prevention, SQL injection prevention).

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### Step 006: Develop mobile-responsive frontend with HTML, CSS, JS
- [x] Design basic page layouts and navigation structure.
- [x] Create HTML templates for key pages (homepage, login, register, dashboards, profile, shift list, etc.).
- [x] Style pages using CSS, focusing on mobile-first responsive design (using media queries, flexible layouts).
- [x] Implement client-side form validation using JavaScript.
- [x] Develop JavaScript functions for dynamic content loading and AJAX calls to PHP backend.
- [x] Create UI for worker profile (viewing, editing, uploading documents).
- [x] Create UI for facility portal (posting shifts, viewing applicants).
- [x] Create UI for skills assessment.
- [x] Create UI for payment method management.

## Phase 4: Feature Integration

### Step 007: Integrate payment systems (PHP/LAMP)
- [ ] Research PHP SDKs or APIs for PayPal, CashApp, Coinbase, Zelle.
- [ ] Implement backend logic for initiating payments.
- [ ] Implement escrow functionality (holding and releasing funds).
- [ ] Develop frontend UI for payment processing and viewing transaction history.
- [ ] Test payment integrations thoroughly in a sandbox environment.

### Step 008: Implement skills assessment and license verification
- [ ] Develop backend logic for Texas state board license verification (web scraping or API if available).
- [ ] Integrate license verification into the credential upload process.
- [ ] Finalize skills assessment questions and ranking logic.
- [ ] Ensure assessment results are stored and displayed correctly.

## Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

### Step 009: Deploy and document LAMP solution
- [ ] Prepare deployment scripts or instructions for a standard LAMP server (e.g., HostGator shared hosting).
- [ ] Create a `database.sql` script for easy database setup.
- [ ] Write comprehensive user documentation.
- [ ] Write technical documentation for setup and maintenance.
- [ ] Test the deployed application thoroughly.
- [ ] Present the final solution to the user.
